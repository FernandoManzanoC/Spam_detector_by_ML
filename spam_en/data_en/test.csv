about istorage networks :
istorage networks , inc . develops and markets network storage solutions that are specifically designed for the small to medium business . computer activity has obviously grown over the last few years , especially driven by electronic mail ( e - mail ) . this demand is further propagated by digital photos , video files and new high image applications . federal requirements for audit trails , medical records and as well as security , add to this acceleration for the need of network storage capacity . istorage with its expertise and experience in the worldwide storage industry , coupled with its technology and channel partners , can deliver products that are simple to use and affordable to meet these needs .
istorage products utilize a new and emerging technology called iscsi . iscsi , is an ip ( internet protocol ) based standard for linking data storage devices over a network and transferring the users data . from the storage side , iscsi uses the scsi command set , the core storage commands used throughout all storage configurations . on the networking side , iscsi uses ip and ethernet , which are the basis for most corporate networks . this revolutionary technology utilizes a standard disk drive interface and internet communications techniques , and provides an easy method for user ' s to manage data .
the purchase orders have been issued through the company ' s international resellers for projects in the automotive manufacturing and petrochemical refinery industry . these orders are the result of our efforts to date in developing the worldwide sales channel for our product offerings , said roger kirkland , vp sales and marketing for istorage . he also added the company is well positioned to support the growing marketplace in the small to medium business sector . these orders are for immediate shipment

hpl or channel .
on the second contract : is hpl making the sale or ena ? is it a sale that is going

can hpl sever the point some other way ?

as i mentioned to you yesterday , it still looks like the volumes for gas delivered to tx glo do not have linda robert ' s origination fee deducted . do we need to execute a pma with txglo to deduct those volumes from the next delievery ?
also isn ' t there an entry that is missing in your file to capture the $ cost of gas for the gas delivered to txglo ? is that being captured in unify or is it being manually entered by gas accounting ?

do we need to execute a seperate deal ticket for the origination deduct ?

"meter 1428 - brandywine / dupont and beamont methanol
my contact at beaumont methanol asked me to tell everybody in our shop the
following : to clarify whom to contact about the nomination and scheduling
for beaumont methanol at meter # 1428 .
first some background : we feed beaumont methanol through a meter station
that we own and control , but which also feeds brandywine / dupont . in fact ,
the gas goes through a dupont pipeline header downstream of our meter station
before it gets to beamont methanol . sometimes we are doing business with
both beaumont methanol and brandywine / dupont . . . . . but sometime we only do
business with one of them .
whom to call for any nominations and scheduling issues for beaumont methanol :
bob dorcheus - brandywine / dupont - 281 - 293 - 1789
chyral hankins - beaumont methanol ( terra ) - 712 - 233 - 6558
please do not call the beaumont methanol control room at the plant with
regard to scheduling and nomination issues . they are out of the loop on
these issues . if we call the beaumont methanol control room at the plant
with regard to scheduling and nominations issues , it will cause confusion of
the type we had yesterday and today .
obviously , it is of course ok for hpl gas control to call the beaumont
methanol plant control room on any emergency operational issues .

"re : killing ena to ena deals in sitara
jay ,
let ' s not assume what impact this will have . even though it is better to zero out deals we ( vm ) wouldn ' t want to go in and zero out 2000 deals .
we do have a few questions .
i would like to discuss what minimal impact is ? how do you know what impact this will have ? is there a reason this will have little impact ? do all of these d 2 d deals have zero volume associated with them ?
who decided to do this ?
why are we doing this ?
what time span are we talking ( production months / year )
let ' s determine the impact if any ?
i would like to meet with you guys and get more detail on why we are doing this and determine the impact ?
thanks ,
m . m .

jay ,
if a deal is killed it poses a problem for us in unify if there are any paths associated with the deal ; therefore , we request the deals be zeroed out . call me if this is a problem . also , we would appreciate further details on why these deals are being killed .
in addition , i have copied rita and mark from volume management for their input .

we will be killing about 2000 deals in sitara tonight . whenever a deal is touched in sitara , it will bridge over to unify . these are desk 2 desk deals , and should have minimal impact on you ."

the degree to which the plant has historically been involved with fuel

how gas schedules are received from the plant
why there were structural differences between the apache / williams fuel supply

tgc ' s experience with optimizing value under the fuel supply agreements
farmer to determine if a "" form agreement "" is available within ena for

it is my great pleasure to announce that the board has accepted my
recommendation to appoint jeff skilling as chief executive officer , effective

retain his duties as president and chief operating officer . i will continue
as chairman of the board and will remain at enron , working with jeff on the
strategic direction of the company and our day - to - day global operations .
jeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all
cylinders and is positioned for phenomenal growth . he is clearly ready for
the job , and after 15 years as ceo of this great company , i  , m ready for a
somewhat different role .
our succession plan has been clear for some time . this has afforded jeff and

forward to furthering that relationship as jeff expands his role .
there are no plans for any other changes in our management team nor broad

"tenaska iv 11 / 00
i am having trouble with the transport deal for the tenaska iv contracts on
lone star . we have deal 452491 in sitara for meter 20014804 at a $ 0 . 01
transport rate . we received the statement from txu lone star and it does not
agree with our deal . they are billing for meter 25000200 at $ 0 . 10 and meter
20014903 at $ 0 . 02 . these meters relate to the tenaska iv sale deal 384258
and the tenaska marketing deal 459898 , respectively . should our deal match
what txu is billing or is there another deal that i am missing ? i haven ' t
worked with transport very much , so i could be confused . i think we have
this problem with oct 2000 , also , but i have not reviewed it yet . i am going
to look at it this afternoon . tenaska iv has already reimbursed us for the
txu transport , so we will need to pay this next week .
also , now that we have the actuals for nov 2000 , we need to update the demand
fees to reflect the correct volumes . barring any changes , i have listed the
adjustments below and attached my spreadsheet . the unify adjustments will be
over by about $ 20 . 00 from the spreadsheet . i thought it would be better have
the cleburne desk at zero , than to leave a balance .
1 . deal 529856 - change 11 / 1 demand fee from $ 341 , 250 . 47 to $ 493 , 365 . 74
( difference $ 152 , 115 . 27 )
2 . deal 529856 - change 11 / 2 demand fee from $ 167 , 062 . 50 to $ 159 , 721 . 55
( difference $ 7 , 340 . 95 )

"re : hl & p for 12 / 99
it is the pipelines decision on how to allocate between the shippers ,
however , if the pipeline allocates the shortage to ena then we need to follow
the contract language and bill accordingly . just remember that we allowed
makeup on the 18 , 19 , & 20 th for a total volume of 5 k over 3 days so that
will apply toward the 4 th and part of the 9 th . all other volumes should be
purchased back per the language in the contract . remember they have a
tolerance of 5 % below the nomination .

the oi | and gas advisory
now that oil and gas has entered a long - term buil market ,
our speciaity in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy piays has produced soaring returns .
emerson oi | and gas ( eogi ) is an energy developer in the us oil beit
and in canada ' s most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia | of miilions per week .
breaking news ! ! !
emerson oi | and gas identifies lease opportunity in south texas
providing opportunity
for 22 - well re - entry in fieid with strong producing history and large
recoverabie reserves
south texas in a | arge existing fieid that was discovered and driiled
by major oil companies
in the 1970 s . the field is estabiished with substantia | recoverable
reserves , estimated at over
3 . 9 miilion barreis of oil and about 2 biilion cubic ft . of gas in the
two pay zones .
symbo | - eogi
price - . 065
the value of eogi ' s shares wi | | skyrocket :
1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest buil
market in a generation .
2 . natural gas prices have tripied in the | ast two years .
3 . with multiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth muiti - miliions , eogi is seliing for | ess than 1 / 4 the
vaiue of its assets .
4 . emerson oi | and gas specializes in using new technoiogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises .
aiready shares in the oi | and gas sector are rising faster than the
overail market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related . but it ' s in the mid - sized
explorers and deveiopers | ike emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are
being made . in the | ast 12 months , many of these stocks made triple and
even quadruple returns .
our subscribers need to pay particularly ciose attention to undervalued
eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for | ong . this smail company
with a comparably sma | | market value , is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especiaily with
the daily jump in energy prices .
but a | | that wi | | change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move
into production , bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market , and have an equa | | y expiosive
effect on the share price .
what will the cash fiow from these projects do for the price of emerson
oil and gas ' shares ? wel | we do know this - the great thing about
investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases
in the price of oi | and gas . even if energy prices stay fiat , or
deciine
slightiy , you will stil | make a very heaithy return . of course , energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted , meaning the value of eogi ' s assets and earnings
wil |
soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors wi | | be
staggering .
overal | , we consider eogi to be one of the | ast outstanding energy
piays in the oi | and gas sector . once this discovery has been realized ,
eogi shares wil | surge sharpiy on heavy investor attention . we have
identified this discovery for immediate accumuiation . eogi ' s oil and
gas reserves are well estabiished and are going into massive
production .
eariy investors wiil secure optimum gains , and any additiona | news in

"enbridge buys koch ' s east texas midstream assets for $ 231 m
ngi ' s daily gas price index
published : october 26 , 2001
enbridge buys koch ' s east texas midstream assets for $ 231 m
enbridge energy partners lp is buying gas gathering , treating , processing and transmission assets in east texas from koch midstream services for $ 230 . 5 million . the package includes all of the east texas system , which gathers 400 mmcf / d for delivery into the carthage hub .
enbridge energy company president dan c . tutcher said the assets are a "" natural fit "" with enbridge ' s existing texas assets and will significantly expand the company ' s "" geographic footprint "" in the region as well as its energy commodity mix . "" we expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to the partnership ' s distributable cash flow , and excellent prospects exist for further organic growth of the east texas system . ' '
enbridge partners will acquire 1 , 880 miles of various diameter gathering lines , 37 compressor stations , four gas treating plants with a capacity of 595 mmcf / d and three gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 375 mmcf / d . the transaction is anticipated to close in december .
the intrastate system derives revenues from the purchase , transportation and resale of natural gas . additionally , when natural gas liquids fractionation spreads are positive , the option exists to extract ngls from purchased gas , thus leveraging income with incremental processing revenue , the company noted . the partnership expects that the direct commodity price exposures inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing will be suitably mitigated through a hedging strategy .
it forecasts gas supply available to the system will be 400 - 420 mmcf / d in 2002 . based on this estimate , the acquisition would contribute incremental ebitda of between $ 26 million and $ 32 million for the year , while distributable cash flow would increase by between $ 0 . 10 and $ 0 . 15 per unit , with further improvements anticipated in 2003 . the forecasts assume that acquisition financing will consist of 50 % debt and 50 % equity , in line with enbridge partners target long - term capital structure .
enbridge partners also reported third quarter net income of $ 6 . 6 million , or $ 0 . 13 per common unit , compared with net income of $ 14 . 2 million , or $ 0 . 42 per unit , for the third quarter in 2000 . the decline was attributed mainly to an adjustment to oil inventory due to shippers of $ 5 . 4 million . the adjustment was the result of what enbridge said were refinements in the oil loss estimation process , as well as improvements in the accuracy of measuring oil losses while developing new software applications .
third quarter deliveries were 1 , 208 million b / d compared to 1 , 272 mmb / d for the same period in the prior year . the partnership expects that deliveries will increase over the remainder of the year , to average between 1 . 30 and 1 . 33 mmb / d . however , its delivery estimates for 2001 and 2002 are down from prior expectations because of lower production forecasts for conventional heavy crude oil , which stem from the current wide price differential between heavy and light crude . for 2002 , growing oil sands production is anticipated to boost full - year average deliveries to between 1 . 35 and 1 . 43 mmb / d .
"" the partnership ' s forecast indicates that crude oil delivery volumes , which have languished for the past several quarters , will start to improve modestly in the near term with more significant increases occurring in the latter half of 2002 , "" said tutcher . "" the major contributing factor will be increased production from the immense oil sands reserves in western canada . we also anticipate further successes from our acquisition strategy , which will increase earnings and diversify our sources of income . the partnership ' s primary objective over the next two to three years is to accelerate the growth of cash distributions to unitholders . to that end , we are confident that the acquisition of the east texas facilities combined with some improvement in liquid hydrocarbon deliveries will position the partnership to consider a distribution increase in 2002 .

i am uncomfortable putting a deal out there without more details . here are
my questions :
1 ) why was this gas just discovered now ? and where has it been hiding ?
2 ) adonis is a wmbe which means he has a direct pay agreement so never pays
for gas taken . we have to invoice
the actual burner for this gas ( hl & p , tu , cp & l , etc ) . can we identify end
user and see if they paid for this gas or will have to pay .
3 ) adonis has skipped town and is no longer in business . hl & p told me he
got paid for gas that never was delivered ( rumor ) .
how can we invoice him now ?
4 ) 60 , 000 mmbtu seems like a high volume of gas to slip through the cracks
for almost two years . answer the above questions and
i will be glad to approve this .

"re : exxon company , usa global # 96035668 / sitara # 212225
i have re - checked sitara & verified that the above deal was a term , firm
deal . this resulted in a gtc purchase firm contract being set - up in the
global contracts system . the term of the gtc was set as the term of the deal
( 4 / 1 / 00 thru 3 / 31 / 01 ) with no evergreen , meaning that the contract will
expire at the end of this month .
to the best of my knowledge , all gtc purchase firms have the same language &
they do not have evergreen . they expire at the end of the primary term .
so , unless exxon negotiated a deal with different , special language to allow
for evergreen & included something about a "" 10 day notification "" to
terminate , there isn ' t any reason to "" terminate "" this contract .
if this is the case , please advise . otherwise , i don ' t think we need to do
anything . the contract will expire at the end of this month on its own .

for a start please review your pipe coverage that is planned on your desk with the netco team you will have to work with and forward me that breakdown . i know you took a preliminary look at this but i want you all to rethink and give me a "" final or startup "" list . the list you gave me on the contracts required for netco on the pipelines has been consolidated and is being reviewed . i believe we need to take a look at some of the intrastates and key ldc ' s and get that info on the list . seating plan should be simple once we get a better handle on the layout for 5 & 6 . i ' ll try and get some details today . don ' t know if we will be allocated spots on 6 . it systems layout and structure is already being planned / discussed . most likely we will get involved in some testing once they start laying out the new architecture .
in addition any other items for a re - start that you can think of please forward to me .
of course we still have the major hurdle of securing a buyer and once / if we do what do they actually submit a bid to purchase . let ' s be optimistic and hope they are interested in the netco structure that has been laid out . regardless we still need to do all of the tasks listed below to get ready .

"this week ' s woodworking tip . . . follow - up
good afternoon !
no , this isn ' t a new tip - just a follow - up on the one i sent this
morning . i received some good responses and wanted to pass a couple of them
along .
kevin wrote to say that this tip works like a charm , except for one thing :
he ' s had trouble with the router bit not being perfectly centered on the
base , so his dadoes have ended up less than perfect . i referred to this
briefly at the end of the tip , but here ' s a quick solution for avoiding
the problem .
before routing the dado in the gauge , first mark a point on the base of
your router . ( i simply add a piece of masking tape since it ' s easy to
see . ) then when routing the gauge ( and later , the panel ) , always keep
this mark against the straightedge . your dadoes should be right on .
another email came in from mike , who suggested making two alignment
gauges . then you can clamp one at each end of the workpiece before you
clamp the straightedge fence down . this prevents the "" wiggling "" that
often occurs when one end is clamped before the other . great tip !
a big thanks to all who have been sending in suggestions . it ' s great to
hear that so many people are enjoying the tips .
talk to you again in a few weeks .

about the company :
the primary objective of hpng is to participate in specialty finance
within the public and private markets . hampden has partnerships
with finance and in surance companies to provide collateral backed
high yield short - term financing .
hampden is a unique finance company that uses new technologies to
help track and protect loan portfolio assets . the use of
sophisticated tracking technology significantly lowers the risk of
high yield lending and allows the company to benefit from unique
situations and under serviced investments . in addition to physical
asset backed lending , hampden grp . will also actively participate
in structured financial contracts with small public companies
through pipe ( private investment public entity ) transactions .
hampden plans to service private and small publicly traded companies
that have a need for short - term working capital and cannot obtain
traditional financing .
hampden ' s business plan provides collateralized financing to
its customers with annualized rates of return greater than 25 % . the
company ' s valuation , financial ratios , executive compensation , exit
strategy , and other management decisions are driven directly from
the business plan . ( source : news announcement 10 / 15 / 04 )
will hpng explode higher as more and more investors become aware of
the stock ? if you think so , you may not want to wait until it is too
late . remember , timing your trade is critical . good luck and happy
trading .

"enron net works
it is becoming increasingly clear that the development of ecommerce will have
a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad
array of industries . through enrononline , enron has quickly become a major
catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries .
enrononline has been an enormous success since its launch . since launch , we
have completed 67 , 043 transactions on line , with a total dollar value of over
$ 25 billion . enrononline is now the largest ecommerce site in the world .
we believe that the competitive success of enrononline is due to one very
specific reason . in addition to providing a web - based platform for
transactions , enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the
site . we stand ready at all times , in any market conditions , to buy and sell
at the posted price . this converts a  & bulletin board  8 ( the more typical
ecommerce concept ) into a true market . there are very few , if any ,
competitors that can provide this capability .
we are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies . if we are
correct , this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for enron .
accordingly , we are initiating a major new effort to capture this
opportunity . effective today we are creating a new business , enron net
works , to pursue new market development opportunities in ecommerce across a
broad range of industries . it is likely that this business will ultimately
be our fifth business segment , joining transmission mike
mcconnell , chief operating officer ; and jeff mcmahon , chief commercial
officer . these individuals will comprise the office of the chairman for

i have no problem sticking around with the group , it is a compliment and i am glad that you all appreciate what i have been able to contribute to the group . i just want your opinion on something .
one of my many goals while a part of the analyst program is to become a senior analyst or third year analyst . it is a promotion that also brings with it a bit of a pay increase . in no way do i want to imply greed , or that i will only stay for money , but if in your opinion i may be deserving of this , then maybe we could run it by bob or the program , or whoever is in control of that .
just a thought , let me know what you think .

we are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 nat gas product commencing tomorrow ,
may 24 th .
the product is a month - long physical nat gas product traded off the texas
desk . it will be identified as follows :
us gas phy exxon katy wkd juno 0 usd / mm
this product is different from the usual products traded on the texas desk in
that the product description has an
indicator of wkd , which designates that the product only moves gas on a day
that is a monday , tuesday , wednesday ,
thursday or friday .
these products will not bridge into sitara . risk personnel will need to be
diligent to identify these products based
on the information in the product description to ensure that the products are
entered into sitara correctly ( presumably -
strips of monday - friday trades and the corresponding month - starting days
and / or month - ending days ) .
we understand the potential impact of having to manually input these
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between eol and sitara and consider
building bridge capability . in the
interim , we anticipate that the trading volume on these products will be low ,
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase .

thanks , bob . it now turns out that due to operational issues , the additional 10 , 000 / d may not come on next week . spinnaker is having problems dealing with all the condensate associated with this gas and may not have the proper equipment in place to allow the additional gas to flow and also handle the additional condensate associated with that gas . i ' ll keep you posted .

the texas general land office transport volume is in pops for may nominated at 4 , 800 / d . deal # 535132 was initially set up as a wellhead purchase from texas general land office . the transport volume of 4 , 800 / d comprises approximately 22 % of the total volume nominated at the meter .

ranger oil company sit 533410 5 , 886 / d 27 %
the houston exploration company sit 535119 5 , 045 / d 23 %
it appears that the texas general land office transport volume is not properly included in sitara for may - see deal 535132 , which shows 0 as the expectted volume . texas glo has historically transported about 23 % of the gas at the n . padre is . block 883 l .
once it starts flowing , the incremental 10 , 000 mmbtu / d should be allocated to the deals mentioned above based on the proportions shown above .

here is an idea for this week . ? next week brad cox is planning on starting a
discussion series based on the experiencing god study , that he will modify
for teenagers to be used in neon . ? it will probably consist mainly of
questions similar to what you ' re getting this week . ? at this point in the
semester your kids hopefully feel comfortable with each other to go ahead
and spring right into some biblically relevant discussions . ? make sure ,
though , that you do what is necessary for your kids to connect with each
other and with you as adults and to make visitors feel at ease . ? spend time
visiting together as a group , and then individually with the kids after neon
is officially over with cokes and cookies . ? remember that that the "" before
and after "" is probably the most important aspect of neon .

"lacy ' s eye exam
hi bubba !
lacy got her eye exam yesterday . he said that she is very near sighted , but
the diabetes has not affected her eyes at all . that was a relief . she ' s been
having headaches , so i was concerned . they probably have been from her blood
sugars being out of control . she is doing so much better now . i have
stopped waking her up to check it in the night & the levels are so much
better . she ' s acting a lot more like her old self now . a lot nicer to me . i
guess her sugars out of control & all the stress of tiger dolls was what was
wrong with her . she doesn ' t say the cruel things to me that she used to . i
knew something had to be wrong with her . i thought surely i had not raised a
child with such a mean spirit . anyway things are a lot better .
tell cole that mimi hopes his eye appointment goes as well as lacy ' s . let
him call to tell me about it . i hope he gets his teary eye "" fixed "" .
lacy ' s eye doctor talked more about her teeth almost than he did her eyes .
he couldn ' t believe her teeth are so perfect without braces . and she is so
tanned , you can see her a mile away with those white teeth shining when she
smiles . she has a dentist appointment for cleaning at the first part of next

today enron and hades announced a definitive energy services agreement said
to be worth an estimated $ 666 trillion .
in the deal , enron will provide both gas and electric commodities to hades '
facilities throughout and under north america . john d . rockefeller , former
ceo of energy monopolist standard oil , is now head of hades ' energy
management division . said rockefeller , "" obviously hell has significant
heating demands . while eternal flames are a great idea in concept , they
require vast and reliable fuel resources . enron was the only supplier
willing to make a deal with my boss , and , as a former monopolist , i just
like the way they do business . ""
a spokesperson for enron said the two cultures were able to work easily
together during negotiations . according to the company , "" the deal fits both
companies exceptionally well . with hades ' ability to attract and retain new
customers , we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for millennia to
come . "" according to several energy industry insiders , hades ' high heating
demand with very little need for summer air conditioning make it a very
attractive energy portfolio addition .
hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and
approximately 173 quintillion customers . the entity boasts sustained high
growth rates over the last two thousand years .
enron is one of the world ' s leading energy and communications companies .
the company owns approximately $ 37 billion in energy and communications
assets . enron ranks in the top quarter of fortune ' s "" best 100 companies to
work for if you can keep a job there and don ' t mind working 80 hours a

gold properties are controlled in bolivia , south america . ( source :

possibilty of an absolutely huge week as massive pr campaign has
started and is expected to last all week . pp

( otcbb : mbah ) : this stock closed at . 01 on september lst . this
little giant closed at . 06 on october 8 th , up 500 % in about 5
weeks . do you think ibm is going to move like that anytime soon ? p
as many of you may agree , some , not all , of these stocks move in
price because they are promoted , making a very large number of
investors aware of the stock . the awareness is underway on dmxp ! pp
let ' s look at the company , delta mining and exploration corp .
otc : dmxpp
about the company : p
delta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxp is a mineral exploration
company that controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres
( approximately 11 sq . miles ) in montana . the properties are all
located over what management considers to be some of the most
prospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states .
another 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are
controlled in bolivia , south america . initial work has revealed
that the bolivian properties display similar potential to those
found in north america . p
the management team is led by chief executive officer , dr . barry
rayment , who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration
company to the next level . dr . rayment brings 32 years of
experience in the field of geology , along with running some of the
most successful mining companies in the industry . dr . rayment was
the president of bema gold corp . , ( amex : bgo ) , a company with a
market cap of close to a billion dollars . he was also affiliated
with glamis gold , gold fields mining and amselco exploration ( bp
minerals ) , among others . his vast experience in the mining sector
along with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an
extraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company
moves forward . p
among the support team is stephen kay , a geologist with more than 30
years experience in exploration throughout europe , south africa ,
south america and the united states . while with gold fields mining
corp . , stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent
drilling of the 3 million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california . p
delta has experienced significant technical success since its
start - up in 1997 . for example , delta has discovered the first
in - situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead
kimberlite , southeast of lewistown . the company also controls part
of the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown
the three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator
minerals - a major step toward finding the presence of economic
diamonds - including pyrope ( garnet ) , chromite and clinoprroxene . p
an aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to
discover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this
under - explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing
kimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta , canada . p
in bolivia , delta controls approximately two - thirds of a highly
prospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia
group of concessions covering 7 , 860 acres ( 12 sq miles ) . the other
one - third is presently being explored by de beers . in addition to
the independencia property delta controls more than 2 , 000 acres
comprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays
all the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further
exploration is justified . p
delta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing
its extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also
by acquiring additional diamond properties . delta will focus on
identifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining
companies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and
finance additional exploration . p
in addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta
controls , they also control a gold property with great potential .
the property is near la paz in bolivia , where initial analysis
revealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an
extensive exploration program . pp

the stock this weekend and next week ? if you think so , you may not
want to wait until it is too late . remember , timing your trade is
critical . good luck and happy trading . pp

we have made the following modifications to the enrononline applications .
stack manager changes
fill order enhancements - ( effective tuesday september 25 )
? to fill a top of stack order in stack manager , right click on the pink shaded order in the depth window of stack manager and select fill .
? the trader now has the ability to fill limit orders that appear at the top of the trader ' s stack on both sides .
? the order will now be filled at the full order volume regardless of the trader ' s stack volume .
? filling an order will not move the trader ' s price or cause a hedge to occur .
resize floated stack windows - ( effective tuesday september 25 )
you will now have the ability to resize the stack window to the desired extent .
website changes ( effective monday september 24 )
limit order restrictions on physical transactions -
? customers will not be allowed to transact with themselves on physical transactions . if a top of stack limit order has been placed on a physical product the counterparty or desk that placed the order will not be allowed to transact on it .
? if a customer or desk has top of stack limit orders at different prices on both the bid and offer and subsequently moves the price of one so that they are at the same price , both orders will be cancelled . the customer would have effectively transacted with himself .
please call me if you have any questions . thanks .

i ' m not sure what ' s going on , but i did not see a teco deal ticket in mops
for houston pipeline company anywhere ( january 1999 to march 1999 ) . i did
see one on houston pipeline company resources .
as my original note stated , i think this is a buy / sell which means that teco
gas processing should appear in both the market and supply depending on
hplc ' s position .
please let me know something asap .

pops hplc transport delivery 12 - 41500 - 203 done ( there )
mops hplc sale to teco gp 12 - 86978 - 101 needed ( think this is buy / sell

above referenced . i have checked our database , and it appears that we have
not . the contract in the system does reflect at gs at this point .
i also checked on teco gas processing company , and it does not appear we have
seen the paper on this one either .
thank you ,

"new stack manager
there is a new version of stack manager which is being released this evening ,
for use on monday morning .
changes
1 ) "" inactivate suspended children "" - new menu item available by
right - clicking on a parent product . it will change all child products of the
highlighted parent from "" suspended "" to "" inactive "" . note that this will be
applied only to the product which you highlight . it will also show available
when highlighting products which are not parents , but it will have no effect .
2 ) the transaction list has been amended to correctly display only those
transactions completed on the calendar day ( problem has affected australia
and singapore ) .
3 ) a constant spread which is changed from the front page of the stack
manager will stay as changed for that product . the spread will persist even
if transactions occur .
background
suspended child products continue to have their prices updated as the price
of the parent changes . inactive child products do not have their prices
updated . the price update process slows down enrononline processing and stack
manager response , so it is advantageous to ensure all non - active products are
in an inactive state .
if you have any questions on the above , please contact the enrononline call

"re : saudi arabia
i spoke to mr . maldinado this morning and it doesn ' t look good . he claims he
has a connection to the minister of "" energy "" who will allocate gas to him . i
asked where would the gas be delivered , and he said anywhere you want it .
short term or long term ? again , anything you want , but probably long term is
better .
i pointed out that there isn ' t an energy minister in saudi and would he know
the name of the minister whose giving him the gas ? he stumbled and couldn ' t
remember the name .
finally he said "" what do you have to lose ? just send me a letter requesting
gas with the specs , location and duration "" and he ' ll do his best to get it .

fyi . . . .
this change went in for the deal validation group . it gives them the
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back .
impact to logistics - unify
if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge
backed , it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name
will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place .
one problem may be with the imbalance data sets , which are not in production
yet . . . . . . ( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths )
this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where
nominations were sent for entire month )
can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe
guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing .
unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause
an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order
to get a clean quick response .
what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take
place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? )
i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i
can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to
put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when
these type of changes are needed .
will keep you posted .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with
confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution :
if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and
then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message :
"" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure
pipeline allows this change . ""
some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is
feedback - i assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems
( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal .
before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask
the unify team .
there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im
market east - but not from
ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be
the same legal entity .
"" warning - not the same legal entity ""
also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals
( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .
once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items
were locked down for a reason .
if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created
using these deals will get corrupted . always check
with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in
unify .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other
than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) .
in addition , this release will also capture "" near - time "" the contract changes
that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be
necessary .
new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal
manager .
new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out
of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) .
once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you
are looking for will appear .
i mention "" near - time "" because we are constrained by the amount of time it
takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then
updates its information

i just spoke briefly with brian riley , who is working to restructure the knig
ranch contracts with exxon , and put coastal into the loop . yesterday i
forwarded each of you an e - mail from steve van hooser which had drafts of
contracts attached . as i talked with brian , the king ranch set up as he is
negotiating will be simplified . the intent , as i understood it , is that we
will no longer buy at the wellhead . rather , coastal is entering into a a
gathering agreement with hpl to buy at the wellhead and ship to the plant .
hplc will buy at the tailgate of the plant , net of pvr . so there will not be
future settlements with exxon on liquids . the paper has not been returned
from coastal or exxon yet , but the deal is effective 4 / 1 / 00 . everything will
be under new agreements , with receipts and deliveries by different
counterparties . the gas flow continues the same , just under new contracts
and different counterparties .
daren , pat and stella : daren , brian said he would get with you to discuss
the deal in further detail . please include pat and stella in the discussion
also . the contracts should be reviewed and understood to ensure proper
scheduling . as i mentioned to greg sharp and brian , it is critical that we

"microsoft update warning - january 7 th
minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed .
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military
sources said .
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble .
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night .
the attack "" indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""
shortly after the first blast , a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not
immediately known .
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks .
there was no immediate information
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated .
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties .
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded .
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident .
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,
palestinian medical and security sources said .
the children between the ages of 6
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said .
the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .
in response , the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military
sources said ."

"new enrononline functionality
the following additions and modifications to stack manager will be effective as of saturday september 8 , 2001 .
stack manager modifications
inactivate all stack - in addition to the individual activate / inactive stack buttons , there is now an inactivate all stack button . similar to the suspend all button , this button will inactivate the trader ' s stack on all active products . any existing top of stack limit orders will continue to post to the website and remain transactable . see screen shot below : inactivate all stack button on far right .
please note that we have switched the positions of the suspend and inactivate buttons in stack manager .
fill order - if a product is set up as either restricted top of stack or top of stack the trader now has the ability to automatically fill any order that is at the top of the stack . in order to fill a limit order that is at the top of the product ' s stack , which will appear in pink , the trader should right click anywhere on the stack window and choose "" fill order "" . the volume filled on an order will be that which is offered by the trader . in order to fill the complete volume of the order , the trader will need to adjust the volume in his stack .
floated stack windows - if the stack is inactive on a product , the price and volume fields on the my products tab will continue to be blank . on the depth window and floated stack window of these products the trader ' s prices will be in gray and italics . children of products that have inactive stacks will not be gray and italicised in the floated stack windows and will not see the calculated prices .
no auto inactivate stack - it is now possible to keep a product active even if the trader is not logged into stack manager . if the trader wishes to enable this functionality on the upper right corner of the product properties page the trader should choose "" no auto inactivate when stack manager is down "" .
changes regarding suspension of products
stack manager will inactivate products rather than suspend them in the following cases :
? market close - if a product is active at the end of its trading hours its stack will automatically become inactive rather than suspending . in order to keep a product ' s stack active past the set trading hours , the trader should choose "" keep awake "" next to the trading hours section of the product properties page .
? auto suspend now inactivates stack - on a product with the auto suspend function enabled to monitor the price changes on the product , the product ' s stack will be inactivated if the suspend at level is reached . this feature can be used by checking the enable box on the product properties page under the auto suspend section .
? logging out of stack manager - when you log out of stack manager without inactivating or suspending your products , the system will now inactivate your products rather than suspending them .

"re : koch midstream services co
tina ,
koch never returned my calls . based on the contractual information , we may be
putting ourselves in a risk area by ' assigning ' the deals without proper
documentation . the documentation that was supplied did not refence any ena
agreements , nor any specific meter numbers . if the purchase was indeed a
meter / well sale ; there should be documentation listing the meters acquired
and the effective date . since we are apparently the supplier , the risk is not
as substaintial as if we were the purchaser . however , without documentation
we are basically relying on the relationship btw koch & duke .

since koch has told you that they sold the properties to duke , i would say
that duke should be paying us for the gas .
i had heard that koch sold the properties to another counterparty , but i
wasn ' t sure to whom . i either talked or left a message with someone in the
settlements area about two months ago about this after koch informed the
trader that they should not be getting the invoices . however , i never heard
back from anyone .
this is related to the ces acquisition which came online the first of this
year . the deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to koch . i can
change the tickets in sitara to the duke counterparty ( or create new tickets )
today if you need me to , so that we can get the invoice out the door . you
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct
contract in place for the deal .

ll - 1 - 0030 - comitas ( sitara # 144052 ) and ll - 1 - 0027 - volpe ( sitara # 144049 ) . my
former accounting contact at koch , michael thomas , said that koch sold these
south texas assets to duke energy field services back in 1999 . michael faxed
a contract which i forwarded to cindy balfour flannigan in the contract
area . cindy said she can ' t tie the deals in the contract to our system so
she can ' t recognize the assignment . cindy has left messages with koch , but
she has not been able to resolve the issue . koch is refusing to pay for
the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to
these deals . i need to find out whether koch or duke is responsible for
paying for this gas . do you have any information regarding this issue ?

subject : tribute to america
subject : tribute to america
i needed to read this in light of yesterday ' s events . . . . .
tribute to the united states
this , from a canadian newspaper , is worth sharing .
america : the good neighbor .
widespread but only partial news coverage was given
recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from
toronto by gordon sinclair , a canadian television
commentator . what follows is the full text of his
trenchant remarks as printed in the congressional
record :
"" this canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the
americans as the most generous and possibly the
least appreciated people on all the earth . germany ,
japan and , to a lesser extent , britain and italy
were lifted out of the debris of war by the
americans who poured in billions of dollars and
forgave other billions in debts .
none of these countries is today paying even the
interest on its remaining debts to the united
states . when france was in danger of collapsing in
1956 , it was the americans who propped it up , and
their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the
streets of paris . i was there . i saw it .
when earthquakes hit distant cities , it is the
united states that hurries in to help . this spring ,
59 american communities were flattened by tornadoes .
nobody helped . the marshall plan and the truman
policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged
countries . now newspapers in those countries are
writing about the decadent , warmongering americans .
i ' d like to see just one of those countries that is
gloating over the erosion of the united states
dollar build its own airplane . does any other
country in the world have a plane to equal the
boeing jumbo jet , the lockheed tri - star , or the
douglas dcl 0 ?
if so , why don ' t they fly them ? why do all the
international lines except russia fly american
planes ? why does no other land on earth even
consider putting a man or woman on the moon ? you
talk about japanese technocracy , and you get radios .
you talk about german technocracy , and you get
automobiles . you talk about american technocracy ,
and you find men on the moon - not once , but several
times - and safely home again .
you talk about scandals , and the americans put
theirs right in the store window for everybody to
look at . even their draft - dodgers are not pursued
and hounded . they are here on our streets , and most
of them , unless they are breaking canadian laws , are
getting american dollars from ma and pa at home to
spend here .
when the railways of france , germany and india were
breaking down through age , it was the americans who
rebuilt them . when the pennsylvania railroad and the
new york central went broke , nobody loaned them an
old caboose . both are still broke .
i can name you 5000 times when the americans raced
to the help of other people in trouble . can you name
me even one time when someone else raced to the
americans in trouble ? i don ' t think there was
outside help even during the san francisco
earthquake .
our neighbors have faced it alone , and i ' m one
canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get
kicked around . they will come out of this thing
with their flag high . and when they do , they are
entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are
gloating over their present troubles . i hope canada
is not one of those . ""
stand proud , america ! wear it proudly ! !
this is one of the best editorials that i have ever
read regarding the united states . it is nice that
one man realizes it . i only wish that the rest of
the world would realize it . we are always blamed for
everything , and never even get a thank you for the
things we do .
i would hope that each of you would send this to as
many people as you can and emphasize that they
should send it to as many of their friends until
this letter is sent to every person on the web . i am
just a single american that has read this , tribute to
the united states

"weekend oncall notes
friday 1 / 19 / 01 - received a call from sheila at basin regarding a well which
may be coming on this weekend ( meter 9696 ) . phone lee in gas control
regarding same . lee informed me that hpl would prefer that the volumes are
not brought on until a field tech can pull a sample and verify that there are
no liquids involved . lee further informed me that the same day to tejas at
hardy was not in the system , and , per gary hanks , needed to be corrected .
lee informed me that the volumes were actually split 10 m at hardy / tejas and
10 m at lomax . i went into sitara and updated the deal ticket , pathed and
nominated over to pops .
saturday 1 / 20 / 01 - 8 : 30 am sean paged regarding the nomination at dow
freeport , he was questioning the validity , as we do not often flow at this
meter . i checked and the nomination was good for saturday ' s gas day . sean
informed me that the valero refinery was up and down and would be going
completely down on sunday .
10 : 00 am - sean called regarding tejas laporte , meter 665 . apparently , the
meter had a confirmed volume of 20 m and hpl / ena had no deal at the meter .
checked in pops and discovered that the deal was confirmed at 20 m on a deal
volume of zero . informed sean that the tejas volume was confirmed . also ,
per sean koch george west ( meter 6722 ) had a nomination increase of 10 m ,
which he wanted to confirm .
sunday 1 / 21 / 01 10 : 00 am sean paged regarding the dow meter 1442 , pops still
showed a confirmed voume of 10 m which dow and oasis showed at zero for
sunday . i checked the system and confirmed that the meter was indeed at
zero and phoned sean back to confirm . checked on mtp hardy , sean informed me
that we came in on rate for saturday and that current meter activity looked
good ."

as in my email below to daren , we are seeing some oa variances between flash to actual on the ple contracts on pgev for 10 / 00 - 12 / 00 . i have verified with thu nguyen of what the statements from pgev show and that is also what we have booked in unify and recorded to the g / l as an imbalance . however , when looking in cpr ( under cpr pipeline exchange ) , there was not anything flashed for those months , thus our oa variance . i seem to remember that stacy once said that although we may run an imbalance at the end of a month on occassion , in those few times that we do , 1 ) it should be relatively small and 2 ) in the following days of the next month , we should have worked the imbalance down to zero thus having no imbalance at the end of the month . in a voice mail from daren today , he seemed to think the same thing was happening or even that by the end of each month , we were balanced to zero . can you shed some light on these months and let me know if we should have had an imbalance and if we should have , why there would have not been anything flashed . if we should not have had an imbalance , then we ' ll need your help to figure out what went wrong in that pgev shows an imbalance on their statements . let me know what you think . . . . . . . . .

attn : director / ceo ,
a cry for family help .
i am mr francis oma the first son of the late mr . peter oma . my father had served mr b . h . lions who was an irish citizen and a successful farmer in our remote village . my father served him for many years and inherited his farm after his death . my father became an executive member of the farmers association in the western mashonaland province of zimbabwe . he also became a successful businessman , because of the recent uprising in my country and the war veterans and farmers clashing , my father decided that it would be safer if my younger brother and i move to south africa to escape the violence .
we left zimbabwe with two boxes containing the sum of us $ 11 . 5 m ( eleven million , five hundred thousand united states dollars only ) and valuables ( diamonds ) worth us $ 5 m . my father has instructed us to deposit it with a private security company on our arrival .
he also instructed me not to reveal the contents of the box to anyone for security reasons and all the documents pertaining to this deposition .
barely two months after we moved to johannesburg , we got information that my father ' s farm had been invaded and that my parent and most of his workers had been killed . my father ' s property and farmland have now been taken over by the war veterans .
i believe that this has been the work of people who did not like my father because of white owned farms . we could not even attend the funerals of my parents as we also now fear for our dear lives . our reason for contacting you is to seek for your assistance in providing an overseas bank account where we can transfer this fund . have in mind that this is a risk free business as we have conclude a modality for the transfer . your participation gives you 20 % of the total sum , 7 % for all expense in curred during this business while 73 % is for my younger brother and i . the diamond will be discussed at our arrival .
we do not know much about diamonds or how to invest this money so we will also need your assistance in this regard . we have agreed to give you a share of the money if you are willing to assit us , should this proposal meet your utmost consideration , please do not hesitate to contact my brother or me on the above email address .
the confidentiality of this proposal cannot be overemphasized as we believe that you will oblige with us the needed security and attention it demands . please treat this proposal with the utmost regard , and the confidentiality of these business should not be over - emphasised .
please response on this email address ; francisoma @ zwallet . com
waiting for your favourable response .
thanks and god bless ,

attached please find the hours survey and instructions for the month of may ,
2000 .
i am sending the survey out this time as an opportunity to introduce myself
to those of you i have not yet met . i am being asked to take a direct roll
in the further development and rollout of the operations pricing model ( fka
transaction cost model ) . in the past , i have directed the implementation of
several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the
operations pricing model ( opm ) . over the past couple of weeks my
observations of the model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of
data used in the model . it will take efforts by both you and the opm team to
get to a satisfactory level of data quality . this process can start with
this months data collection efforts . please pay particular attention this
month as the "" bar is being raised "" by the management of energy operations for
data quality and timeliness .
while completing the survey , take this time to review last month ' s numbers .
please return these surveys to shari mao by end of day friday , june 2 .
please note the following changes :
the nat gas rc ' s will now see deal validation and transportation rate
activities therefore , these surveys will be notably longer but will not
necessarily take more time
if the survey does not contain an activity that your team spends time on ,
please do not type any activities in the survey . contact jennifer reside at
# 35971 to discuss how to proceed .
if you have any questions relating to the model or this survey , or are unable
to meet the survey due date , please call jennifer reside at # 35971 ( shari is

refurbs save cash ! why hesitate getting the best
value by getting the exact same equipment , with original
manufacturers warranty at a much lower price .
q :
what
is considered factory refurbished ?
a : there are lots of
things that can label items factory refurbished . some are so
frivolous , its laughable . but because consumer laws prevent
manufacturers from selling anything considered factory refurbished
as "" new "" , the second consumer gets the best deal . here are a few
examples :
manufacturers /
distributors are not allowed to export outside their territory /
country .
to avoid
"" disturbing "" the dealer / reseller channel in different
countries , manufacturers and distributors cannot export the
product , as new and therefore label it as refurb .
most major retail
superstores offer a 30 - day money back guarantee on their
products and there are those consumers that just simply take
advantage of that . these items are returned to the manufacturer ,
inspected and repackaged like new .
items where the
box or casing was damaged in shipment , which are returned to the
manufacturer .
the item was
returned to the manufacturer because of a slight defect . the
part that was defective was replaced by the manufacturer , tested
and then repackaged just like new .
the item was
returned because of a minor cosmetic blemish on the casing that
was corrected .
demonstration
units are also considered factory refurbished . these units are
inspected , tested and repackaged .
the box was simply
opened . thats it !
brand new
overstocked items are also labeled factory refurbished .
all factory
refurbished products are inspected serviced by the
manufacturer then tested and repackaged to meet original product
specifications . all
merchandise is warranted by the original manufacturer

subject : consensual terminations
as you are aware , legal is coordinating with the trading / origination groups in handling consensual termination transactions of our in - the - money positions with counterparties that are willing to do so . could you please spread the word that these transactions should not be done by entering into offsetting trades , but rather by entering into a termination agreement with our counterparty and the counterparty paying to enron the agreed upon value . thanks .

"accomplishments
sorry for the delay . . . ami
1 . tom asked for a historical number for entex the 2 nd week on the job in the
morning meeting . he wasn  , t expecting me to bring forth anything because i had
just started . no one provided any information after the first day , so i
decided to look it up and do it myself . tom was very pleased .
2 . tom gave that info to ed , and he asked for further data :
a . about cinco ranch , greatwood , and spring interconnects
i coordinated with brad blevins and applied it to the fact that origination
was booked for nov , but the points had yet to be operational . brad and i
remain in close contact to share any entex interconnect info .
b . research transport info
documented why entex transport volumes decreased by 6000 , and used info
towards the audit
c . check weather forecast for nov
i got weather info from mike roberts and developed some volumes that
corresponded with historical data related to the average of the forecast . tom  ,
s response was , "" this is great . why hasn  , t anyone been able to do this
before . ""
3 . prepare and present entex info in morning meetings and prebid meetings .
4 . work with weather research group to get better understanding of entex
trends .
5 . prepare information gathering entex data including :
midcon vols
price behavior
temperature and weather conditions
hpl vols
6 . thoroughly understand and apply entex contracts :
- realize need for daily vols and mentor summer intern to put together data
base of historical information ( winter cap )
- recognized accounting discrepancy that saved us $ 11 , 000
- reorganized entex tracking spreadsheets to incorporate a variety of info ,
including booked volumes , weather , and contract terms
- part of the audit team
7 . managed weather hedge ( swap and put )
after doing some background work , i found out that the weather research group
was incorrect , and their files were feeding incorrect data ( iah temps instead
of hou temps ) . this find resulted in a gain on of $ 3 , 376 , 780 .
8 . handle ces deals on the texas desk
- organized and facilitated a meeting with back office to review all ces deals
- incorporated all ces info with enron systems
- fully gather all data
- liaison between devon and enron ( whole trade floor )
- ensure all information was correct
- praised by :
joan quick - "" you went above and beyond the call of duty ""
howard camp - "" when i met with the other regions , texas was the only one that
had its the info in line and organized ""
9 . develop good relationship with entex
10 . facilitate monthly meeting with cross - functional entex team to resolve
issues , discuss current happenings , and to keep everyone in the "" know ""

flowed for tufco . steve told me 8 . 300 . i have gone back into mops and
corrected these volumes . this should impact the ua 4 number . also , this

these pills are just like regular cialis but they are specially formulated
to be soft and dissolvable under the tongue . the pill is absorbed at the mouth
and enters the bloodstream directly instead of going through the stomach .
this results in a faster more powerful effect which still lasts up to 36 hours .

per conversation with rosa brown and thu ( in volumes management , beaumont
methanol is a swing deal , by which the gas sales allocations are handled by
the scheduletr . thu indicated that you were the scheduler for meter # 981428 .
do you still handle the sales allocations for hpl meter # 981428 ? if so , can
you confirm 02 - 01 sales ( on hpl , meter # 981428 . , sales deal # 603107 ) , to
beaumont methanol ( which we  , ve invoiced them ) , vs . chyral hankins  , e - mial to
buddy majorwitz below ? the only date that is really in question is sales for
flow date 02 - 13 - 01 ( she reflects noms of 0 vs . the 3 , 811 mmbtu that we
invoiced them ) .

"procedure for adding new capacity tickets for multi - desk service
utilization
in order to provide the ability to track transport expense by desk , sitara
was modified to allow multiple transport capacity tickets for the same
service contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is
tagged as "" primary "" . here is the procedure for setting up new capacity
tickets to reflect the "" other "" desks :
a . you will probably first notice this via a warning / error message in path
manager when building a new path . the message will read something like
"" source / destination 123456 for desk imct does not match service contract 3434
and will be removed . ""
b . make note of the deal number in the service list of the service contract
that you were using in the new path .
c . open that transport capacity deal in sitara . then hit copy .
d . on the new deal :
change the buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the supply
or market deal that you are pathing with . if it a contract for which we are
agent , then don ' t change the buyer but instead change the agent to the new
desk . the "" primary "" deal will carry the actual agent .
changing the buyer causes the contract field to get blanked out . re - select
the contract .
just above the various exchange line items is a primary deal check box .
un - check it .
on each exchange line item , change the mdq to zero and for any negotiated
rates , uncheck them as well . the "" primary "" deal will carry the mdq and
any negotiated demand , commodity or fuel .
hit release .
e . you may need to re - retrieve path manager . you should see the deal number
in the service list now read "" multiple "" . right - click / service deals will list
the specific deals .
f . re - build the path as you originally desired . the warning / error message
should not appear again .
this could occur for any combination of desk and service contract .
please file this in your "" call dave if i can ' t find this "" folder .
thanks , d . n ."

"texas market analysis
team :
i have asked troy denetsosie to be responsible for compiling and updating a detailed supply , market and infrastructure analysis of texas . this information will support both our origination and trading activities and we will use a lot of the format ( website and other ) developed by the other regions . spcifically , troy will offload a lot the analysis work that jd is currently doing on the market side and he will work closely with bryan hull to support the more immediate needs of the traders .
the deliverables from troy will be : ( 1 ) a texas section on the gas fundamentals webpage modeled after the central region , ( 2 ) a daily report on gas flows , deals , basis positons , etc . , ( 3 ) a detailed infrastructure analysis ( maps , flows , etc ) that will support the development of our supply / market hub positions . please give him your support .

subject : fw : crm database
as you know , much of jd , mark and my time to date has been geared around finding what companies , customers , phone numbers and past business that we may have done with the customers we started with and move forward from that starting point . in the few short weeks we have addressed , uncovered and started down the road to what i hope to be a very profitable 2001 - 2002 .
the crm database should be a great tool for those that follow . it appears that the originators would log in calls , meetings and any other business that gets discussed with the customer . this would have been a great tool for our group to have had in starting from ground zero .
there still appears to be some developmental issues around this program . in the meantime , we are using a number of spreadsheets to keep up with our business . should the crm database not be approved or delayed , we have decided to populate the act 2000 ! database . this is currently supported by enron but is not as user friendly as the crm would be . the cost for act 2000 ! is relatively free !
if you have any questions , please let me know .

subject : crm database
on thursday of this past week i went to a meeting regarding the crm database which is designed by siebel for the purpose of handling customer information .
the crm database has only been implemented with trading / origination groups within enron and provides the following capabilities :
1 . account & contact management
2 . activity tracking & planning
3 . potential deal management
4 . outlook synchronization
5 . remote connectivity / synchronization
6 . e - mail from siebel and records activity
the current enron groups that use this system are the enron industrial markets that was implemented in may 2001 and the freight markets that was implemented in august 2001 . the following is a list of how these groups have been utilizing the system :
industrial mkts freight mkts
users 175 45
counterparties 8 , 200 20 , 000
contacts 14 , 000 20 , 000
activities 1 , 200 900
quotes 150
opportunities 361 11
the following groups have also inquired about this system and having it implemented :
eol
global mkts
ees
transportation
east power orig
insolvent debt
some of the basic costs and timeline for this system are $ 120 - $ 150 , 000 for 20 - 30 users with a 5 week timeline for implementation . this is a basic implementation that may not include all of the functionality shown above ( i . e . , no remote connectivity ) .
the reason that i have written this is to show a possible system that could be used by the gas floor origination and trading groups to manage contact information and share data among groups . the cost to implement this for all of the origination groups does not appear to be prohibitive and it could be implemented in a good time frame . some of the issues are coordination among the groups and the desire to share information . let me know if you think this is a viable possibility and what would be the best way to approach the other origination groups .
colin tonks , database / system guy , within the fundamentals group was also at the meeting and thinks this would work great . he would be the individual coordinating efforts from the natural gas system side .
thanks ,

cell phone & have her call me when she gets there - - i think - - i don ' t
know - - she ' ll be mad about that too . but the other night , she didn ' t eat
right after she took her shot , then didn ' t eat anything fast acting & got in
the truck to go over to phillip ' s to get research info from his computer , got
low & had to pull over & eat sugar tabs . so that ' s what scares me . she knew
to eat righ !

her when she leaves home .

"lacy ' s eye exam
please respond to hi bubba !
lacy got her eye exam yesterday . he said that she is very near sighted , but the diabetes has not affected her eyes at all . that was a relief . she ' s been having headaches , so i was concerned . they probably have been from her blood sugars being out of control . she is doing so much better now . i have stopped waking her up to check it in the night & the levels are so much better . she ' s acting a lot more like her old self now . a lot nicer to me . i guess her sugars out of control & all the stress of tiger dolls was what was wrong with her . she doesn ' t say the cruel things to me that she used to . i knew something had to be wrong with her . i thought surely i had not raised a child with such a mean spirit . anyway things are a lot better .
tell cole that mimi hopes his eye appointment goes as well as lacy ' s . let him call to tell me about it . i hope he gets his teary eye "" fixed "" .
lacy ' s eye doctor talked more about her teeth almost than he did her eyes . he couldn ' t believe her teeth are so perfect without braces . and she is so tanned , you can see her a mile away with those white teeth shining when she smiles . she has a dentist appointment for cleaning at the first part of next week . we ' ll talk later about when we are coming to your house . i ' m going to longview to a singles retreat sat . in case you call & i ' m not there . will be home sat . night . love ya , maw"

"important information about united healthcare - please read !
to : houston area employees participating in the domestic medical plan benefits
you may have recently received communication from united healthcare ( uhc )
concerning memorial hermann health systems ' ( mhhs ) decision to terminate
their contract with uhc in the houston / beaumont area . this communication
also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network
due to this action . it is our intent to help you understand the situation .
it is our understanding that memorial herman health systems asked for a 40 %
increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to
you and enron ! when united healthcare attempted to negotiate with a counter
proposal , memorial hermann cancelled their contract .
while this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and uhc ,
enron continues to support uhc in their ongoing contract negotiation
efforts . at this time , it is only uhc which has been affected , however , it
is our understanding that cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group
and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well .
many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals
within the uhc network or have contracted directly with uhc including those
with admission privileges to the woodlands , sugarland and clear lake
hospitals , to name a few . in a further effort to limit disruption to our
affected employees and families who are enrolled in the uhc network or epo
options , enron has authorized uhc to process claims incurred between
september 28 and december 31 , 2000 as if the termination of the memorial
hermann health systems from the network had not occurred and in - network
benefits applied . office visits will have a $ 10 copayment and all other
charges will be covered at 90 % . hospital admissions will still need to be
pre - certified with uhc .
these steps have decreased the number of participants ' affected by primary
care physician disruption from 1 , 050 to 127 .
if you need medical attention : you or your doctor / hospital must call uhc ' s
customer service number so proper benefits can be verified . in some cases
the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed .
if this should happen , please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to
uhc with a claim form for prompt reimbursement . claim forms can be obtained
by calling 1 - 800 - 332 - 7979 or in houston at 713 - 853 - 7979 ( press 1 ) .
open enrollment materials will be coming soon . take this opportunity to
consider your elections for 2001 .
united healthcare and enron hr are committed to assisting enron employees
through this transition . we will communicate any further developments that
may impact you or your family ."

"re : meter 1428 oct 99 - beaumont methanol
i ' m sorry , did we discuss bmc ? ? ? .
lee can confirm the accuracy of this , but bmc bought 20 , 000 from us and
intended no swing and no buyback . brandywine ( dorcheus ) controlled the meter ,
therefore it is their responsibility to make up the overs and unders . i
believe a deal is in place with brandywine to cover that very issue for
november . if not please let me know .
lee , if this is not your understanding for nov . business please let us all
know .

subject : re : meter 1428 oct 99 - beaumont methanol
lee ,
i need you to answer a few questions to resolve this issue .
first , you show a deal volume of 20 , 000 on nov . 7 and the pipeline confirmed
this volume . is this the volume you agreed to sell beaumont methanol ? this
volume is in agreement what the deal ticket says , the volume confirmed by
hpl , and dorcheus ' s volume .
second , the buyback issue is that a buyback is set up until june 2000 per
julie meyers notes she sends out every month ( last note sent dec 3 and you
are on distribution list ) . brandywine has nothing to do with this issue . it
is an issue between hpl and beaumont methanol .
do we have an active buyback in place and how do you decide to use the
buyback ?
this is a commercial issue that i need further clarification from you if you
have a buyback in place or not . if not , please notify julie and note on the
deal ticket that this buyback is no longer effective .
if it is still active , please contact chyral and resolve .
let me know the final resolution .

"re : prc meeting agenda recap
to clarify the discussion below : i will not be discussing the promotion
candidates with sally prior to her prc meeting on 6 / 19 / 00 .
as a reminder , our prc meeting will be held on tuesday , 6 / 13 in eb 37 cl ,
beginning @ 12 : 00 noon . lunch will be served , and yvette has drinks and
snacks throughout the day . our goal will be not to have dinner , but if
necessary , we will . i suggest each of you to make arrangements to stay as
late as needed to ensure we reach a quality work product .
our agenda :
review of ground rules and responsibilities of the committee .
each of you will provide a general business assessment of your team . hr
challenges should be identified along with needed skill sets , gap analysis
and succession planning . the template below should be used for the format .
i am not interested in discussing the business goals , but you probably need
to think through these in order to discuss the assessments that we will want
to discuss as a group .
review and discussion of exempt employees . each will be categorized into the
six descriptors used in the feedback process . i am expecting each of you to
have a listing of accomplishments from your employees along with factual
feedback and observations which will allow you to place your employees into
appropriate categories . i would like to stress that the data to sustantiate
the performance descriptor should be factual and documented . the focus of
employee discussions must be on each employee ' s individual contribution
towards accomplishing our business goals . we must safeguard our discussions
from "" he said , she said "" periferal distractors , and focus on the work product .
promotion candidates discussion .
once again , the prc process is a valued process at enron . each of you have
been through it , so you understand the importance of confidentiality .
additionally , the committee will be required to reach an unanimous vote .
please come to the meeting with your "" enron "" hat on - not your individual
group hat . our people are critical to our business . therefore , it is
important for us to be honest when evaluating our staff . we must identify
our stengths and weaknesses , and work towards strengthening our people to
ensure the very best business service we can provide . what this means is
that we should provide our employees with the very best constructive feedback
possible . in some cases , you may be providing a tough message , but it is our
responsibility and obligation to ensure that each employee fully understands
expectations , where they are on point and where they are not on point of
meeting these expectations so that they can have the next six months to build
needed skill sets and / or correct behaviors . this is your obligation as their
immediate supervisor . if you have any questions , concerns or issues you
would like to talk about prior to the meeting on tuesday , please contact me
or hector .
in advance , i appreciate your time , energy and professionalism in this
process .

"ranks communication
after getting your imput , i think this is the best :
we will only communicate needs improvement and issues . there will be
differing messages for needs improvement which fit the situation - some need
to hear that they are not performing at a high enought level relative to
peers to help us achieve business goals or for them to be considered for a
bonus ( may need to finda another role within or outside enron which is a
better fit ) . message to someone new to enron in that category should be
different . glad they are here : believe that as they learn the organization
and their job that they will be able to make significant contribution : doing
the right thing to learn business , but that contributions to date are not
significant enough to warrant payment of a bonus .
let me know what you think .

as a follow - up to stephen schwarz ' s message below regarding training
resources , i wanted to let everyone know that there will not be a charge in
2000 for any energy operations employee to attend any training classes that
have been developed by energy operations ( i . e . , sitara , unify and
magellan / livelink ) . there will be a charge to your rc , however , if an energy
operations employee signs up for one of these classes and fails to cancel
within the established guidelines .
i know there was a lot of concern regarding your budget and costs for
training classes after the corporate training department announced that there
would be a change in policy this year . your rc will be charged a fee for any
course that your employee signs up and attends through ernie . i just wanted
to clarify the costs associated for any systems training detailed above will
not be charged to your rc even though you and your employees use ernie to
register for these classes . i have instructed the people in the training
department who are in charge of billing to follow this policy . if you
receive a charge in error on your rc report , please let me know immediately
so that i can make the necessary corrections .

the july lst - 15 th pay period , it will be reflected on your july 31 st pay
advice as  + pvacation  , .
? flex dollars will appear on the earnings section of the pay advice instead
of as a credit in the deduction section . the various benefit deductions will
remain itemized in the deduction section .
? if you transfer between enron companies during the year , your year  ) to - date
totals will carry forward to the new company pay advice . previously , the
year - to - date totals started over when transferred to another company . this

pay advice throughout the year . ( note that your w 2 at the end of the year
will reflect your earnings by company ) .

payroll faq  , s
my paycheck has a line called  & other deductions  8 , what does that stand for ?
there is a fixed amount of lines to print deductions on the paycheck . for
some employees , the number of deductions are more than we have room to
print . in this circumstance , the system totals all remaining deductions and
prints them on one line  ) titled  & other deductions  8 . the detail of all
deductions can be viewed on the pay advice that is displayed on the intranet
at ehronline . enron . com .
what do the earnings or deduction codes on my paycheck mean ?
these definitions are listed on the payroll webpage located at
hrweb . enron . com , select enron payroll from the side index .
why is my overtime not reflected on my paycheck ?
overtime is paid one pay period in arrears , therefore it will be reflected in
the next pay period . for example , if you reported overtime for the
july lst  ) 15 th pay period , it will be reflected on your july 31 st pay advice
as  + povertime  , .
what is the limit for social security ( fica ) ?
for year 2000 the limit is $ 4 , 724 . 40 on a wage base of $ 76 , 200 . this limit is
applied to each enron payroll tax company . therefore , if you transfer to
another enron company these limits will start over , however , the total amount
withheld across all companies will be reflected on your paystub . excess fica
will be credited to you by the irs via your tax return .
what federal income tax rate is used for my bonus or when i exercise stock
options ?
there is a standard federal income tax rate of 28 % for these earnings . this
can be higher if the employee has completed a supplemental tax form

big , strong , reliable .
dear sir ,
i know this proposal will come to you as a surprise
expecially when you do not know the writer ,
condsidering , the huge sum of money involved which could make any
apprehensive .
let me start by introducing myself to you , i am mr . igho kadiri director credit control , union bank of nigeria plc . lagos . i saw your contact during my private search at the information centre here in nigeria chamber of commence and industry and i want to believe that you

kq 430 plane crash . the deceased , engnieer theopilius baker , banked with us and has a closing balance as a july 2000 worth $ 4 . 5 m ( four million five hundred thosand usd ) . which my bank , now expectes a next - of - kin
to claim as the beneficiary of the funds , efforts has been made by union bank of nigeria to get in touch with the baker ' s family or relative but to no success .
based on the perceived possibility of not being able to locate engnieer theopilus ' s next - of - kin , the management under the influence of our chairman and the board of directors are making arrangements for the funds to be declared unclaimed and channeled to an unknown
account .
it is based on this that we have contacted you to stand as the next - of - kin of late engr . theopilus baker so that the funds , will be released and paid into your account
as the beneficiary and the next - of - kin to the deceased . all documents , and proof to enable you get the funds have been carefully worked out as we have secured from the different offices concerned for the smooth transfer of the fund to your nominated account . it has been agreed that the owner of the account will be compensated with 20 % of the remitted funds , while we keep 75 % and 5 % will be set aside to offset expenses and pay the necessary taxes .

"re : big cowboy for august
mary :
is the issue below confirmed volumes versus actual flow ? the large variance
between confirmed and actuals began in june 2000 where 30 mmbtu was scheduled
for dix ranch and zero for the big cowboy and big cowboy # 2 wells . it
appears that the volumes for these wells were scheduled at despain where
985 , 350 mmbtu was confirmed . this well has never flowed this much volume ,
and in june 2000 it flowed approximately 320 , 000 mmbtu . do we actually have
support ( i . e we talked with someone or have a nom sheet ) for the 985 , 350
mmbtu that was entered into mops as confirmed ? this trend of "" nothing "" being
confirmed at these three wells continued until july 2000 . in august 2000
this scenario changed and 612 , 388 was confirmed at dix ranch and nothing was
scheduled at the big cowboy and big cowboy # 2 wells .
from reading your memo below it also appears that more volume is flowing at
these wells that we expected . if the issue is an actual increase in the
volumes flowing at these wells , i would suggest that you call our gas
measurement department and ask them to audit coral ' s charts . coral may be is
calculating the volumes incorrectly .
this could also be an allocations issue . the allocation as it is in the
system today closely agrees with the allocation statement that i receive
monthly from karen lambert at tejas . the only differences between the tejas
schedule and what is in mops are the acock production and gain or loss which
are not scheduled and therefore not allocated . i know that you are working
on the acock production and tom acton and i are working on the gain / loss .
tom will tell me how to path the gas so that i can set up accounting
arrangements for april 1999 forward . scheduling will have analyze and
possibly rework january through march 1999 because these months were
originally set up in pops .
i want to help , so if i have missed the issue ( s ) would you please clarify it
or them for me and let me know if i need to do anything for you .

subject : big cowboy for august
daren & tom ,
beginning with august production , i noticed that big cowboy , into king ranch
appeared to be flowing approximately 9 m over the nomination / day . per a
conversation i had with fred boas today , i discovered that two wells with
zero noms flowed a considerable volume .
they are as follows :
rocher big cowboy ( 27002 ) - 42 , 000 approx .
big cowboy # 2 ( 27003 - 84 , 000 approx .
total flow : 126 , 000 mm ' s , more or less
i think that this may be part of the production increase which we are trying
to account for , in addition to the acock production at the briscoe well which
came on in august . please let me know what you think . i would like to make
sure that we are capturing our purchases correctly for both accounting and
our economics .
thank you ,

daren - thank you for the list of the true , remaining ena sales customers . i
have been researching your list & getting the contractual volumes that brenda
needs . i am confused about praxair though .
the sales contract between ena & praxair was assigned to hplc eff / 10 / 1 / 99 .
the only remaining contract between ena & praxair is a master financial
agreement .
does praxair really need to remain under ena or is it okay under hplc ? if it
really needs to be under ena , we will need to un - do the 10 / 1 / 99 assignment to
hplc or set - up a new contract between ena & praxair .

cheryl ,
the counterparties with which ena currently sales gas are :
city of brazoria
central illinois light company
d & h gas company , inc .
markham gas
merit energy partners
praxair
reliant energy - entex
reliant energy - hl & p
southern union company
texas utilities fuel company ( now txu fuel co )
union carbide corporation
unit gas transmission company inc
ena has transacted with the other companies listed below , but that will most
likely not happen again . ( hpl will trade with those counterparties . )

generated out of cpr that can list all deals by counterparty for ena . let me
know if you need something like that .

subject : ena sales on hpl
i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you
could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for
which she is looking .
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any
ideas / suggestions / help that you can offer ! ! !
thanks in advance ."

"new version of stack manager
introduction
in response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide , we have
upgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we
hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your
products .
this new release will be automatically installed within the next few days .
please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade .
summary of new features
multiple children - a "" child "" product can be the "" parent "" of another child
( multiple links in a chain ) and different types of links can be placed
against a single parent .
static product bar prices - when you change a price in the product bar and
hit the "" + "" or "" - "" button , the price stays - it does not reset to the amount
in product properties until you logout .
sorting - you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on
the title of the field . for multiple sorts , hold down your "" shift "" key .
parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis
relationship identified . ( e . g . the product bar might before have said : "" basis
link - parent "" and now would say "" stand alone , parent "" ) .
detailed feature descriptions
multiple children
the new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together
in a long chain . for example , child product a can be linked to parent product
b , which is in turn linked to parent product c .
warning : although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a
chain , system performance is degraded by large chains . this is because when a
customer attempts a transaction , the database must "" lock "" each and every
product in the chain before it can process the transaction request . the
database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the
locks . "" vertical "" chains ( multiple parents and children in one long link ) are
much slower to process than "" flat "" chains ( one parent with many children ) .
large vertical chains should be avoided .
related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the
same parent . for example , child product a can have a basis link to parent
product b . at the same time , child product c can have a syncopated basis link
to the same parent product b . parent b is the parent for both a syncopated
basis link and a regular basis link .
static product bar prices
the new version of enrononline provides for "" sticky "" product bar price and
volume changes . when you change a number on the product bar , it does not
reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you
have logged out . this makes it easier to update prices , volumes , spreads or
offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the "" + "" or "" - "" buttons .
one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it
reduces repeated price movements . with the old version of stack manager , if
the price delta was too small , traders would often repeatedly hit the price
movement buttons . each of these price changes must be communicated across the
website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth . this makes it harder
for customers to transact with us - each time they try , a new price update
moves the price , resulting in an increased transaction failure rate . entering
an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price
movement button means that fewer ( but larger ) price movements are necessary ,
improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure
rate .
you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices - a new field
for offset to last trade . this allows you to update the offset for products
which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu .
sorting / selecting
the new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting
functionality over the old . you can now choose any field heading ( type ,
location , reference period , etc . ) and sort by that item . you can do multiple
sorts by holding down the shift key . example : if you select type and then
location while holding the shift key , you will see your products sorted first
by product type and then within each product type , by location ( in
alphabetical order ) .
if you right click on the product menu , you can choose from the same sort
criteria , plus you can select "" sort by web order "" , which allows you to see
your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the
website ( note however , that a customer on the website might be also seeing a
number of products in addition to the ones you are managing ) .
when you select products , you can drag your mouse while holding down the left
mouse button as always , but now you can also hold down the key while
making your selections . this allows you to highlight products which are not
necessarily adjacent to one another .
parent products and f / x products
one of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its
treatment of how parent products are displayed . the old version showed the
type of link associated with the parent in the product bar ( to the left of
the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs ) . the new version
does not show the type of link . this is because the new version allows for
more than one type of link on each parent product .
some traders may notice that their products which have f / x links are now
identified with a stylised "" fx "" in the product list . this is to enable easy
identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the
parent , rather than managed individually .
assistance
as always , if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality ,
please contact the 24 hour help desk ( houston : 713 853 4357 , london : + 44 ( 0 )
20 7783 7783 , australia : + 61 2 9229 2300 ) .
general feedback
if you have any comments on the new functionality , or suggestions for further
functionality , please call david forster on 713 853 1861 . if you had
previously suggested new functionality which didn ' t make it into this
release , rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard
to improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your
requests into the next release of the enrononline stack manager ."
"daren ,
i have no problem sticking around with the group , it is a compliment and i am glad that you all appreciate what i have been able to contribute to the group . i just want your opinion on something .
one of my many goals while a part of the analyst program is to become a senior analyst or third year analyst . it is a promotion that also brings with it a bit of a pay increase . in no way do i want to imply greed , or that i will only stay for money , but if in your opinion i may be deserving of this , then maybe we could run it by bob or the program , or whoever is in control of that .

just the deliveries - not sure why ? ? ? ? . we have been paying the suppliers
based on whatever they invoice us for , which typically has been a smaller
number than what we have in unify . also , we have not been able to get a
contact for the allocation statement . in some cases , we get the summary
sheet , but no detail and some months we don ' t get anything at all . do you
know of a good contact that we can call so that we receive the allocation on
a timely and consistent basis ? the contacts on the allocation statements
that we do have are not returning phone calls . i also need to know what was

i need the above referenced contract put into pops for january , may , june ,
july , and august 1999 forward . i need the contract in pops for august
forward because i never know when copano will allocate line gain to itself .
in 1998 a spot contract was set up between hplr and copano pipeline / south
texas , l . p . with a synergi contract number 078 - 62210 - 101 and a global number
of 96016880 by karen lambert . per karen this old agreement was terminated by
dan hyvl due to hplr business change to ect . in 1999 , when copano began
allocating line gain to themselves again i contacted lauri , karen , and
yourself to see if i could get the contract in pops . karen sent me an e - mail
indicating that she set - up a new contract for this hplc line gain purchase -
global # 96022367 ( i don ' t have a "" synergi "" contract number ) . i know that in
3 / 99 lauri contacted bernard widacki at copano to discuss this issue .
i need lauri to review this and then i need the contract to be put in pops so
that i can correctly allocate the gas at this meter . i have not allocated
any line gain in 1999 and the volumes are small . karen is the most
knowledgeable about this contract , so i suggest that any questions be
directed to her regarding contract issues . karen worked with bernard widacki
at copano to set up the contract originally .

ow ,
i went through the list on the sort by pipe and highlighted the curves / mapping we can delete ( yellow ) and those we can change ( orange ) . the only curves we will have left are katy , waha , hsc , agua dulce , and thompsonville . i expect to be using thompsonville in 6 months to a year . if it easier or cleaner to delete that curve and add it when we need it , that will be fine . let me know if you have any questions .

"2000 plan allocations and january allocations
please read brian ' s memo below . we spoke briefly about this yesterday in the
staff meeting . i have copied each of you on a memo earlier today where i
have provide the 2000 plan allocations . please note that we were not making
changes to the plan , only breaking the gas asset group into smaller buckets .
any chnages which have been made since the budget was approved are not
reflected on the allocation sheet . rather they are reflected on the 1 / 00
allocations , and they will require explanations each month as all variances
from plan do . this includes new rc ' s which have set up , etc .
i need each of you to review the 2000 plan allocations as i submitted them
earlier today , and provide an accurate allocation of your rc for 1 / 00 . what
has your group spent their time on in 1 / 00 ? ? ? please be aware that we could
receive questions from the commercial teams , so document your logic . some
things to consider :
project sally - allocate to gas network development
project hurricane - allocate to ? ? ? ? - ( i have a call into jim coffey )
denver business - allocate to rocky mountain asset originations
if you have some other activities and your not sure where to allocate them ,
either call me , jackie nelson or jim coffey .
one other thing to note : the network trading group will be further broken
down into 2 groups : trading ( tom martin and jim schwieger ) and
transportation ( ed gottlob ) . although the attached worksheet does not
include this breakdown , please include it in yours .
i would like you allocations back to me no later than thursday , 1 / 20 @

the attached files contain the allocation percentages for 2000 plan , january

please update the 2000 plan file to reflect the following changes to the
assets team . the assets team is now broken out into the following "" groups ""
which are described in the attached word document :
rc # team name rc owner
the 2000 plan file now has columns for the above teams , please take the
percentage that was previously allocatated to assets ( which is in the
executive column ) and reallocate it among all of the teams except rocky
mountain asset originations that you support . i have already inserted the
new percentages to be used for rocky mountain , which are based on a portion
of the upstream origination allocation that was determined by the assets
group . consequently i have changed the allocation percentage for upstream
origination . i have also protected all of the cells except the ones you need
to change to avoid confusion .
i also need you to update the percentages to be used for january 2000
actuals . i have added the new rc ' s that we have set up since plan has been
complete , so please make sure you have each rc 100 % allocated .
i will need the updated plan percentages returned to me by noon wednesday

"subscribers receive first notice on run - away stocks
traders ' monthly alert
january pick ( bmxg ) exploded from . 20 to 2 . 07 ,
a gain of over 900 % in 6 days ( 1 / 18 - 1 / 24 ) !
our next pick is an incredible find that will
outperform all others based on their solid
numbers , huge sales backlog , $ 2 billion in
financing , low outstanding shares , and a deal
with chinese government - run companies totaling
$ 10 billion !
urgent buy at any price :
global environmental energy corp .
otcbb - geec
current price - 1 . 90
running to - 6 . 00
geec is cbs marketwatch . com ' s # 1 best performer in the dj
diversified industrials index in the last 2 months . this
is a dow jones industry index that also contains 3 m , ge ,
and honeywell .
we are sending this urgent investor bulletin revealing the
most undervalued pick on the otcbb to our millions of
subscribers for substantial profits immediately !
geec has experienced a recent spike in price and volume
indicating heavy accumulation of shares . this is a sign of
even bigger things to come for this emerging world leader
in the conversion of waste materials into electrical energy ,
an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible
to assign a value to the size of the market .
geec is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their
biosphere process system for the disposal of a wide variety
of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour , making a major
impact on the global waste problem . this profitable and
environmentally safe process converts into clean , green
electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste ,
agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes ,
industrial wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural
gas , and the huge market of used tires .
geec generates 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of electricity
from the waste conversion on a continuous basis which is
then sold to replenish the local or national grid .
the biosphere process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide
need for cost - effective renewable energy sources and a
corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the
disposal of waste . geec has secured international acceptance
for a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact
the global waste problem while a major push for generating
electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot
topic due to shortages and massive power failures .
geec just announced a $ 10 billion , 5 - year joint venture with
chinese government - operated companies , including yanzhou coal
mining ( nyse - yzc , $ 74 ) . the deal is structured to have 1 , 300
geec biosphere systems deployed throughout china to fulfill
an urgent need for waste disposal and energy generation , two
critical areas for a country with a population exceeding 1 . 3
billion people . as china ' s rapid economic advance continues ,
a shortfall of 500 million kilowatts exists annually , prompting
periodic blackouts in all chinese provinces . geec is in line
to profit substantially while providing relief from unmanageable
municpal solid waste disposal and simultaneously helping china
meet its energy needs .
the forecast for geec is crystal clear , and this is just the tip
of the iceberg for this emerging worldwide leader where shares
should be added immediately to every portfolio . we expect a
continuous flow of huge news announcements while shares still
represent an uncommon value for a company of this caliber . look
for the continuation of strong positive developments that will
ignite geec , which earns our highest rating for the most
explosive gains on wall street .

"re : fuel
application of the fuel retained from transportation and treating contracts
doesn ' t have to be done by zone or compressor , in fact i am sure there will
be times when we are either short or long compressor fuel when compared to
the pipelines total usage . usually , short . i just do not think the market
will let me lay off all of this risk . it would be really nice if we could
get the system to track compressor fuel used to service specific contracts
but i am afraid it will always be a facility planning issue . fuel should not
cause imbalances on the transportation contract . a pipeline could be long
fuel due to not running compression and in that case we would have to inject
or hold in linepack the excess . it seems that we would look at fuel on a
total basis .

we need to discuss further . my concern would be that how do we know what %
hpl should be retaining at a compressor or zone to make sure we recoup our
fuel cost ? also , could allocated fuel cause a contract imbalance ? i think
that pipeline operations can handle the scheduling of third party fuel
retainage . but , if we retain fuel on ena transports , then we need to come up
with a plan to nominate this in marketing operations to houston pipeline .
currently , this process is not in place .

there was no flow at meter 981225 for the month of march . the hms technician
did contact measurement once to get the volumes zeroed out but apparently he
will have to get with them again . i have notified the tech and he is in the
process of doing this .
the meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open . gas control ' s
understanding and the field ' s understanding is that at the time the
brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place . if this
is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the
valve .
robert ,
in the future if you have meters like this where there is a small flow
volume without a nomination in place please check with earl and myself so we
can investigate before we get commercial involved .
thanks

"monthly charges for analysts on your rc report
i wanted to let all of you know how you will be charged for analysts if you
currently have or will have one in your rc for the year 2000 . the analyst
program is being handled differently than it was in 1999 . in addition to the
normal salary , benefits and payroll taxes , you will also be charged an
overhead administration fee for the program . you will be charged the
following monthly amounts for each analyst in the detail class code that i
have indicated below :
detail class description amount
1 salaries and wages $ 4 , 000
552 benefits 774
557 payroll taxes 360
820 corporate services 1 , 266
total monthly cost $ 6 , 400
the $ 4000 amount represents an average of all analyst salaries and does not
indicate what the analyst in your rc is paid . this amount will not change in
february as the $ 4000 already includes merit raise information for 2000 .
the $ 1266 represents the overhead costs of administering the program ,
including campus recruiting and office visits .
when you look at your rc report , you will see a line item labeled "" a and a
reclass "" in each of the detail classes identified above . enron north america
is invoiced by corp . for the costs of all analysts . financial operations
makes a manual journal entry each month to charge the appropriate rc . please
check your january 2000 rc report and make sure you were properly charged for
the correct number of analysts you have currently . if there are any errors ,
please let me know as soon as possible so that i can work with brian heinrich
to have it corrected in february . please continue to check your rc report
each month going forward . thanks .

nick ,
i am not sure what happened to this volume . i cannot tell by the audit
trail , but there is a connection between meter hpl meter 987283 , and midt
989807 . the volume you are referring to is on mid - tex pipeline under meter
989807 . it it pathed as a point to point nom with no deal reference . i do
not think this is correct because the deal you reference show hplc as
purchaser . the volume is in mips under meter 989807 , but the supply deal
is set up on hpl meter 987283 , and the audit trail in sitara shows the deal
was moved from midt to hpl . get with thu when she returns to see if she

"enron announcement
car rental options for enron travelers
rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to :
national car rental ( primary ) and alamo rent - a - car ( secondary ) .
the intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage enron ' s total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non - pricing provisions ( i . e . insurance ) .
national car rental , due to its service levels , availability and total value proposition , has been awarded primary status and is recommended as the first choice for enron travelers ' needs .
alamo rent - a - car , a sister company to national , has been awarded a contract reflecting a secondary status , due to its service levels , availability and low cost solutions . alamo is recommended as an alternative to national , where available .
when you rent a vehicle in the united states , ( including puerto rico ) or canada , the following insurance provisions are included , regardless of rate selected :
1 . l / dw ( loss / damage waiver ) - this is what is called comprehensive or collision on your personal auto . it covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it .
2 . liability - this covers people and property outside the rental vehicle . for both national and alamo , the coverage is $ 100 , 000 per person , $ 300 , 000 per occurrence and $ 50 , 000 for property damage .
* * important * * *
these coverages apply regardless of rate selected , as long as the following contract id is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement . ( national - 5000838 alamo - # 143974 )
to enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from enron ' s preferred suppliers , it is recommended that each traveler enroll in national ' s and alamo ' s preferred traveler programs . national ' s emerald club membership and alamo ' s quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return . the enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for enron travelers . enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of enron american express t & e cardholders . you may also find an enrollment form on the enron travel program intranet @ gss . enron . com .
if you have any questions or comments , please contact jeff leath at 713 - 646 - 6165 ."
"jill ,
i have had several discussions with daren farmer and below are a few questions remaining .
ann mag - which plant does this gas come into or out of ? daren farmer indicated that ngpl / trunkline is connected to la gloria ( agua dulce ) and tenn / coral / shannel are connected to the gulf plains plant ( agua dulce minus ) . do we have an option on which plant tailgait we would like delivery ? if so daren said we would prefer the gulf plains plant .
oakhill - are all three at the carthage hub ? if so , then the texas desk will give a quote , probably hsc minus , otherwise the east and central desk will need to quote the volume into tetco and koch mid , respectively .
vaquillas ranch km - what plant processes this gas ?
white heron - where is this ? could not find it on the map and daren was not familiar with this field .
sheridan field - daren assumed this was the shell sheridan plant , but he wanted to verify with you .
hungerford north - where is this ?
bear den - where is this ?
moore ' s station - where is this ?
dan hughes - hpl is quoting this volume ( as well as several other field connected to hpl ) and they need a meter number for this field .
we have one less day to get these quotes than originally anticipated because of friday being "" good friday "" and basically all of the 32 nd floor being out , myself included .
so , let me know via voicemail or email what you can find out regarding the above questions . the properties we do not have any questions on are currently being quoted up , or will be tomorrow morning .

subject : gap certificates
hey guys , i finally found one that is true ! i went down to the
gap myself and redeemed my gift certificates already ! ! ! i sent
enough e - mails to get over two hundred dollars worth of clothes from
the gap ! you know , with all the crap sent over the mail , it is good to
know that something finally rings true in this environment of virtual
deception . send it to everyone you know , and you too can have a whole new
wardrobe , courtesy of the gap ! isn ' t it grand ?
hi ! my name is janelle mccan , founder of the gap .
you have probably heard about the e - mail from abercrombie and fitch offering
twenty five dollar gift certificates to every five people you sent that
letter to . my question is : did it work ? most of you who tried it will
probably say no .
but this letter is not prank like others you have experienced . i am offering
thirty five dollar gift certificates to every seven people you send this to .
when you have finished sending this letter to as many people as you wish , a
screen will come up . it will tell you how much you have earned in gap gift
certificates . print that screen out and bring it to your local gap store .
the sales clerk will give you your certificates and you can shop baby ! this
is a sales promotion to get our name out to young people around the world .
we
believe this project can be a success , but only with your help .
thank you for your support !
sincerely ,
janelle mccan

subject : spinnaker - supply verification 11958 su - october 2000 production
gary ,
when spinnaker got paid , the volumes inadvertently got averaged over the
month . since spinnaker was paid gas
daily pricing for the month , there is going to be a dollar discrepancy when
the volumes are re - sent over on the actual
day of flow . in my calculations ( using gas daily less $ . 21 as the price ) we
are going to owe spinnaker an additional
$ 220 , 398 . 57 .
one issue that needs to be addressed is this : should the additional money go
directly to spinnaker since they are allocating
out october 2000 production payments to ranger and houston exploration ?
attached is a spreadsheet showing where i came up with the extra money owed :
thank you all ! !
christy

ps this does not address the issue between the onshore and offshore meter ,
this is just addressing the redistribution
of volumes for the month of october ."

in regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what i have been
able to determine from the information available to me .
to your questions :
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on
monday when she returns .
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located .
hope this helps .

attached is a contract preparation request for a facilities agreement for the
coastal oil the
legal department has prepared and is currently circulating a ratification and
consent to assign document to reflect this transaction .
we have been unable to locate an existing facility agreement for the 3
previously drilled wells and suspect that no such agreement exists .
the facility agreement requested herein is intended to cover only alterations
to be made to existing meter 098 - 4179 to install an h 2 s monitor and necessary
valving to allow hplc to accept gas from the newly drilled albrecht # 4 well .
once the h 2 s monitor has been installed and the albrecht # 4 well is ready to
flow , we intend to paper the purchase of gas from the albrecht # 4 well only
via a spot confirmation pursuant to a spot gtc . the albrecht # 4 will not be
covered by 96008903 , nor will the wells currently subject to 96008903 be
subject to the spot gtc .
coastal will reimburse hplc $ 39 , 600 for the cost of the installation .

we intend to attempt to connect about 4 , 000 mmbtu / d of new production from
the newly drilled coastal oil in may , 2000 , the meter flowed about 960
mmbtu / d of 3 . 36 % co 2 gas .
the content of the albrecht # 4 gas according to the field gas analysis
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht # 4 h 2 s content
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its
predecessor , mjg , corp . ) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner
sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s
content of the albrecht # 4 to permissible levels before delivering same to
hplc . in your opinion , should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc ?

tradestar
corporation ( tirr ) finishes recompletion of karnes county tx oil well bringing
on 35 bpd in production ! ! !
readers who have
followed oil stock recommendations ( otcbb : svse and asurf ) in the past have
profited nicely . the company tradestar corp . ( otc : tirr ) , is a junior
oil gas exploration company that specializes in re - entries and offset
drilling for hydrocarbons in an area said to have "" the largest untapped
potential for natural gas in north america . "" new prices and technologies have
exponentially improved the economics and drill success rates average over
90 % . tradestar corp . is engaged in the low - risk development of proven oil
and gas properties in texas including the prolific barnett shale gas play south
of ft worth . the rapid oil and gas price increases and recent advances in
economical drilling , completion and production techniques , have resulted in :
1 accelerated development activity and increased land lease
values in this extremely productive area .
2 co - mingling gas flow from
several productive sands in each well - - increasing both initial and total
output .
3 the opportunity to drill new offset
wells - - where success rates are typically over 90 % . ( using oil @ $ 35 . 00 and gas
@ $ 4 . 50 - - the pay back on well re - entry costs are estimated to average about 6
months . oil is currently $ 48 and gas $ 6 ! ! ! !
tirr ' s strategy is to strike oil again !
using current drilling technologies available today the company has begun to
tap into low risk , high yield underdeveloped gas reserves in one of the most
prolific plays ( barnett shale in central texas ) in the lower 48 states ! ! !
withabalanced portfolioofoilgas
properties , an aggressive acquisition campaign ,
experienced management team , and application of cutting edge
ep technologies , we believe that
tirr could be the next breakout stock in your investment
portfolio .
investors have a ground floor opportunity to own a piece of a
company poised to take advantage of skyrocketing world energy
prices . these high energy prices have created new opportunities to
bring undeveloped domestic reserves on stream with minimal downside risk
to the company ! ! ! !
previous news

( otc : tirr ) today announces that it has entered into a joint venture
agreement with united production and exploration of houston , texas to reenter
and drill a binion parker gas well and prospect in erath county , texas . in
addition to the gas well reentry , the prospect , which covers 111 acres , has an
additional location to drill a new well . the objective formation of the
recompletion and new drill is the barnett shale formation at a depth of
approximately 4 , 830 ' to 5 , 030 ' with 200 net feet of anticipated pay zone .
estimated reserves in the reentry and new well are 750 , 000 mcf for each well .
why
we love this stockl . continued

barnett shale of central texas 3 . strong industry investment banking
relationships 4 . strong management - over

conclusion
tradestar corp . ( tirr ) is getting ready to become a major
presence in oil gas fields across texas . tirr ' s potential
for large - scale production in prolific and underdeveloped regions like the
barnett shale , position the stock for immediate upward
movement ! ! ! we believe that tirr is in position to take
the petroleum industryby storm . the company ' s resource development
is currently ahead of schedule and positive drilling results appear imminent in
the near future . revenues are up 50 % over the lst quarter of last
year . don ' t miss this fantastic opportunity . for more

darren ,
the demand fee is probably the best solution . we can use it to create a
recieivable / payable with tenaska , depending on which way the calculation goes
each month . how are pma ' s to be handled once the fee been calculated and the
deal put in the system ?
attatched is a schedule detailing what is on the gl for cleburne as of
today . some of this info will change by the end of the month . as you can
see , there are some discrepancies between megan ' s calculations and what is on
the general ledger . ua 4 is also on my schedule . unless the buys / sells are
volumetrically balanced , we book an entry to balance the desk . this will
change the calculation of what is due from / to tenaska . should we be
recording a ua 4 entry for cleburne ? is it addressed in the agreement with
tenaska ?

in most cases , ena will be a net buyer from tenaska iv for activity related
to the cleburne plant . however , for october 2000 , the plant was down the
majority of the month and ena sold off the supply , resulting in ena owing
money to tenaska iv .
i have created deal 529856 with a demand of $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , which is the
calculated amount of income on the cleburne desk . ( please see the attached
schedule . ) we need to pass this income on to tenaska iv . do we need to pay
this amount ( wire from ena to tenaska iv ) or is there another way to do
this ? this is the case for october 2000 and could possibly happen again in
the future .
greg , troy , jim - please let me know what you think about settling this .
megan - don ' t pay the amount until we here from the greg , troy and jim .
also , make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we
reimburse tenaska iv .

we have actuals . the larger of the two volumes is 1 , 395 , 000 , which is

problem , though , with the way it is coming to settlements . it is showing up
with a jan 2003 delivery date . i think the demand fee needs to be on 10 / 1
only . right now , it is on a line with a date of 10 / 1 / 00 to 12 / 31 / 36 . i
think this is confusing the system some how . also , we still need the
purchase deal for tenaska iv . it should be for a demand fee of $ 2 , 571 , 135 . 73
booked to the cleburne desk . we actually owe $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , but i need to
net the tenaska iv sales with the purchase to clear those receivables . james
is calling me every day asking for an update . do you know when we will be

"zero path termination in path manager
matt / ben :
i am responding to your request for comments on revising path manager by expanding the parameters of the path termination process to include zero volume paths on the last day of the month as a way to speed up unify response and retrieve times .
based on my interviews of various desks including aep and calgary and our recent discussions , we find a legitimate business need to allow zero volume paths to roll from month to month ( requirements contracts on wellhead gas ) . following is a recap of what is proposed to be done regarding zero path termination .
1 . all paths that are zero on the last day of a month ( exception noted in # 2 below ) will terminate on that day and will no longer roll into the following month .
this path termination out function will run every night . any paths changed to zero retroactively will zero out future month ' s paths unless a volume
is on that path in the future month .
2 . zero paths marked as "" always send nominations "" will continue to roll from month to month until changed to some other nomination option . it appears that hpl
( 736 paths ) and nigas ( 1136 paths ) might have some paths rolling that no longer need to . a special one time handling of these paths will be coordinated with the
scheduler when you are ready .
3 . zero paths which roll from month to month using the "" volume management - do not send "" function will cease to do so . this was agree to by patti in regards to
paths for oba tracking .
all :
please respond via e - mail with any comments .

as you are aware , we broke a shaft in the mug compressor on the methanol
unit at clear lake on saturday march 11 th . we originally anticipated a two
week outage for repairs . unfortunately , due to delays in the delivery of a
coupling needed to finish repairs , we have extended the downtime for
another week . we hope to be up april 2 nd or 3 rd if all goes well ."

"fw : the odds are against them
there is no way to undermine the devastation and loss we ' ve all
witnessed and felt over the last couple of weeks , but when you look at the
following numbers and realize how much worse it could ' ve been , i guess there
are a lot of people who were saved . . .
subject : the odds are against them
by now everyone has been hearing the death toll rise
and reports of the
destruction from the terrorist attacks on the us .
these were deplorable
acts
that we will never forget . but now is a time to look
at the other side of
the
numbers coming out of new york , washington and
pennsylvania . the sad
but somewhat uplifting side that the mainstream
media has not reported yet
- the survival rates and some positive news about
the attacks .
* * * the buildings * * *
* the world trade center -
the twin towers of the world trade center were
places of employment for
some
50 , 000 people . with the missing list of just over
5 , 000 people , that means
90 % of the people targeted survived the attack . a
90 % on a test is an ' a ' .
* the pentagon -
some 23 , 000 people were the target of a third plane
aimed at the pentagon .
the latest count shows that only 123 lost their
lives . that is an amazing
99 . 5 % survival rate . in addition , the plane seems to
have come in too low ,
too early to affect a large portion of the building .
on top of that , the
section that was hit was the first of five sections
to undergo renovations
that would help protect the pentagon from terrorist
attacks . it had
recently
completed straightening and blastproofing , saving
untold lives . this attack
was sad , but a statistical failure .
* * * the planes * * *
* american airlines flight 77
this boeing 757 that was flown into the outside of
the pentagon could have
carried up to 289 people , yet only 64 were aboard .
luckily 78 % of the seats
were empty .
* american airlines flight 11
this boeing 767 could have had up to 351 people
aboard , but only carried
92 .
thankfully 74 % of the seats were unfilled .
* united airlines flight 175
another boeing 767 that could have sat 351 people
only had 65 people on
board . fortunately it was 81 % empty .
* united airlines flight 93
this boeing 757 was one of the most uplifting
stories yet . the smallest
flight to be hijacked with only 45 people aboard out
of a possible 289 had
84 % of its capacity unused . yet these people stood
up to the attackers and
thwarted a fourth attempted destruction of a
national landmark , saving
untold numbers of lives in the process .
* * * in summary * * *
out of potentially 74 , 280 americans directly
targeted by these inept
cowards , 93 % survived or avoided the attacks . that ' s
a higher survival rate
than heart attacks , breast cancer , kidney
transplants and liver transplants
- all common , survivable illnesses .
the hijacked planes were mostly empty , the pentagon
was hit at it ' s
strongest point , the overwhelming majority of people
in the world trade
center buildings escaped , and a handful of
passengers gave the ultimate
sacrifice to save even more lives .
pass this information on to those in fear and the
media . don ' t fear these
terrorists . the odds are against them .

this meter has not been disconnected . the measurement tech turned in a
temporary disconnect to mips ( about 2 months ago ) because the meter has not
flowed for approximately 4 months . this allows the measurement tech to forgo
testing the meter until it is ready to be put back in service . scheduled
volumes should be taken to zero until further notice .

subject : houston gas & power controls / standards assessment
as you all are aware , there is a heightened awareness throughout the company
of the need for establishing global trading control standards and developing
a process by which we will track and monitor on a regular basis our success
at achieving those standards . i have been asked by sally to take the lead on
meeting this objective . for the last several weeks , i have been involved in
an extensive review of the london office controls and procedures for their
gas and power trading businesses . we have used the findings of this review
to start developing an assessment of controls , standards and measurement
methodology for the london office .
in order to work towards our goal of developing global trading standards
across enron , we need to perform the same controls and standards assessment
for the houston gas and power businesses ( we will assess global products and
other commodities traded at a later date ) . i will be in houston tuesday and
wednesday of next week to help facilitate this process .
i have scheduled a meeting next weds . , may 17 from 9 : 00 - 11 : 30 in eb 49 cl so
that we may review our controls , define the standards of meeting those
control requirements and assess the risk associated with those controls not
operating properly . before that meeting , i would like for all of you to
develop for your respective functional responsibilities the following :
- a listing of all controls your group is responsible for ( i . e . cash
collections are timely )
- a proposed standard that will ensure each control is being met to its
maximum effectiveness ( i . e . cash is collected within 30 days of deal date
with exceptions noted )
- a quantitative measure to allow performance monitoring of each standard
( i . e . % of cash collected within 30 days )
- a description of current capabilities to calculate , track and report each
measurement ( i . e . automated a / r aging report )
i would urge you to be as detailed as possible in listing your control
functions and to solicit feedback from your managers and leads . a lot of
work has already been done to identify this information so i would hope time
requirements for this will not be extensive . i have attached a worksheet to
be completed with the information discussed above . i have also attached a
high level summary of proposed gas and power standards to use a guideline but
it is certainly not all - inclusive and should be revised as necessary .
as discussed above , we will review the controls and standards listings for
each functional group in the weds . meeting and also assess the risk
associated with each control . i would like to achieve consensus on gas and
power operating standards for houston by the end of the meeting . let me know
if you have any questions or comments regarding this process . i look forward
to seeing you next week ."

i have some information on the e - workorders ( ehurr and ehset ) that were set
up to track the costs of bridgeline . apparently the workorders themselves
were not set up correctly so no costs could be coded to them in msa . we have
corrected the workorder set - ups and they should be working now . as for prior
costs , i think we will be able to get a list of all the payroll costs that we
attempted to code to ehurr and ehset , and then book an entry in april that
would reclass them to the workorders . we would then be able to see all the
costs associated with the project , as you wanted to do from the beginning ,
and code any future costs directly to the workorders . i will let you know
more when i finalize that this can really be done , i just wanted to keep you
updated on the progress .
if you have any questions , please let me know .

lisa ,
what is involved in changing a product description to include this phrase ? i do have some customers in texas that are legally bound to only trade intrastate gas and they are fearful of trading anything that doesn ' t specifically state that .
since it is probably only a handful of customers , if it is a major production , it may not be worth it , but i wanted to check .
thanks .

that will be fine . most people know that the gas in this area is intrastate . but , if someone wants to see that in the description , we can add it .

hi daren ,
bryan hull gave me your name . a customer was interested in trading intrastate gas and bryan had informed me that our exxon - katy location is intrastate . i was wondering if you would be interested in changing the long description on eol for this location to include the phrase intrastate gas so that any customers that are interested would be able to see that . if this is okay with you , i will forward it on to our product development team .
thanks .

"re : meter 1517
daren - after checking with mips , you are correct . jan . 1 only flowed 19
dth . the 5882 dth was a bad estimate . a better estimate was received on
1 / 7 / 00 .
sorry about all the confusion .

phillips said we shorted them gas on december lst so they pulled it on
january 1 . can we verify that we did not deliver 5 , 00 on dec . 1 ? if that is
the case and this was a firm sale , we owe him some gas at dec index less
( . 045 ) . which is bad ! let me know what happened in dec before i can put
this deal out in jan .
